I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), where I am pursuing my interest in designing socio-technical systems to realize an inclusive and just society. 

I am interested in improvising and developing methods to hear the voices of marginalized groups. Acknowledging that design can reinforce the status quo, I seek ways to support the groups to own the output and engage with institutional infrastructures to bring about desired social change.  I leverage participatory approaches that take incremental steps, focused on supporting communities to develop a critical awareness of their existing strengths and surrounding contexts. In the process, I design technology to function as an intermediary in facilitating people to come together, have a say in the process of change, and make moves towards enacting their desired futures. Technology is a means and not an end. 

During my graduate program, I worked on two major projects. The first involved developing integrated computational thinking and science modules for middle school classrooms. In it,  we deployed curricular materials, including simulations and code-based models, in schools in Texas, Virginia, and Nepal. The second ongoing project involves an anti-trafficking organization in Nepal and the sex-trafficking survivors supported by the organization. In the project, I explore avenues that support the survivors in achieving what they call "dignified reintegration."
