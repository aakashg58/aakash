I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/) pursuing my interest in designing socio-technical systems to realize an inclusive and just society. 

I am interested in improvising and developing methods to hear the voices of the marginalized groups to support the groups to own the own the output and be able to engage with institutional infrastructures to bring about desired social change. Acknowledging that design can reinforce the status quo, I seek ways to foster social change by taking participatory approach that take incrementa steps focused on developing critical awareness of existing strengths and surrounding contexts. I technology as an intermediary tool that can facilitate people to come together, support them to own the process of change, and slowly makes moves to enact their desired futures; technology is a means and not the end. 

During my graduate program, I worked on two major projects. The first involves developing integrated computational thinking and science modules for middle school classrooms. We have deployed curricular materials, including simulations and code-based models, in Texas, Virginia, and Nepal. The second project involves an anti-trafficking organization in Nepal and the sex-trafficking survivors supported by the organization. In the project, I explore avenues that support the sister-survivors in achieving what they call "dignified reintegration."
