I designed this course to cover basic structured programming using the C++ language. It was not a course about C++. It was intended for those with little or no programming background. Although prior programming experiences may make it easier, it was intended as a gentle introduction to think like a computer scientist. 

The broader objective of the course was for students to take the learnings from this class to other programming activities that they will do beyond this class so we focused on the foundational ideas behind programming.

Learning Objectives
======
* Understand and use the basic programming constructs
* Utilize various datatypes, such as integers, strings, and arrays
* Isolate and fix common programming errors
* Write small-scale programs (in C++) using the above skills
