This course provided an introduction to fundamental concepts of programming. We covered basic software engineering principles and programming skills using Java. The topics included discussions on simple data types, control structures, array and string data structures, basic algorithms, and testing and debugging. 

In this course, my goal was to help students to see computers as an abstract machine, and support them to model and solve problems using an object-oriented programming language.
