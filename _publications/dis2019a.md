This paper presents our initial experiences introducing and refining a voice-annotated web application to a group of people who have limited experience with technology. We conducted a two-week training program for a group of sex-trafficking survivors in Nepal to help them sell their handicrafts on an online marketplace. We incorporate voices in two senses: by providing naturalistic, extended voice annotation with colloquial phrasing and intonation and by using the survivors' words and images in the interface. The colloquial phrases helped in use and we saw the survivors adopting the phrases to explain the system. We contemplate design approaches to make web applications accessible to people with limited digital fluency.
